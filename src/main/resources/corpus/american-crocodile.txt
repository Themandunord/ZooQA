<title>American Crocodile
<header>American crocodile
The American crocodile is a species of crocodilian found in the Neotropics.
It is the most widespread of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas.
Populations occur from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of southern Mexico to South America as far as Peru and Venezuela.
It also lives on many of the Caribbean islands such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Grand Cayman.
Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to Puerto Rico and the southern half of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area.
The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.
The habitat of the American crocodile consists largely of coastal areas.
It is also found in river systems, but has a tendency to prefer, not merely to tolerate, some level of salinity, resulting in the species's congregating in brackish lakes, mangrove swamps, lagoons, cays, and small islands.
Other crocodiles also have tolerance to salt water due to salt glands underneath the tongue, but the American crocodile is the only species other than the saltwater crocodile to commonly live and thrive in salt water.
They can be found on beaches and small island formations without any freshwater source, such as some of the many cays and islets across the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
They are also found in hypersaline lakes; one of the largest known populations inhabits the Lago Enriquillo.
The American is one of the larger crocodile species.
Males can reach lengths of 6.1 meters, weighing up to 907 kilograms.
On average, mature males are more in the range of 4.1 meters to 4.8 meters in length weighing about 400 kilograms.
As with other crocodile species, females are smaller; rarely exceeding 3.8 meters in length.
This species has a more V-shaped snout, compared to other large crocodiles, which usually have a slightly wider snout.
Adults have a uniform grayish-green coloration with white or yellow undersides, while juveniles have dark cross-banding on the tail and back.
Despite their large size, American crocodiles do not regularly attack large animals, as most large crocodilians do.
Fish, reptiles, birds and small mammals make up the majority of their diet.
On occasion, large mammals such as deer and cattle are taken.
Their dietary habits in coastal regions are not well studied.
Like any other large crocodilian, the American crocodile is potentially dangerous to humans, but it is not a very aggressive species and attacks are rare.
<header>Characteristics
Like all crocodilians, the American crocodile is a quadruped, with four short, stocky legs, a long, powerful tail and a scaly hide with rows of ossified scutes running down its back and tail.
Its snout is elongated and includes a strong pair of jaws.
Its eyes have nictitating membranes for protection along with lachrymal glands, which produce tears.
The nostrils, eyes, and ears are situated on the top of its head, so the rest of the body can be concealed underwater for surprise attacks.
Camouflage also helps it prey on food.
The snout is relatively longer and narrower than that of the American alligator, although broader on average than that of the Orinoco crocodile.
American crocodiles are also paler and more grayish than the relatively dark-hued alligator.
This crocodile species normally crawls on its belly, but it can also "high walk".
Larger specimens can charge up to nearly 10 miles per hour.
They can swim at as much as 20 miles per hour by moving their bodies and tails in a sinuous fashion, but they cannot sustain this speed.
The American crocodile is sometimes confused with the smaller, Central American Morelet's crocodile, a smaller species that is native to Mexico.
<subheader>Size
Newborn hatchlings are about 27 centimeters in length and about 60 grams in mass.
The average adult in the continental rivers can range from 2.9 to 4 meters long and weigh up to 382 kilograms in males, while females can range from 2.5 to 3 meters and weigh up to 173 kilograms, the lower total length representing their average size at sexual maturity, the upper representing the expected upper size limit for the respective sex in most known populations.
In the Tárcoles River in Costa Rica, dozens of 4 meters and a few 5 m individuals frequent bridge crossings and are a popular tourist attraction.
This species is said to grow largest in the South American river basins, but rarely exceed 5 meters or reach 6 meters even there.
Crocodiles on the islands or coasts are usually much smaller in size.
Adult weight in coastal Belize averaged 77.8 kilograms per one study.
In their Florida range, adult length has been recorded as high as 5.2 meters, but adult males on average measure 3.35 meters long, perhaps slightly smaller than mature males from other continental populations.
A skull of this species was found to measure 72.6 centimeters and is estimated to have belonged to a crocodile of 6.6 meters in length.
Large, mature males regularly weigh about 400–500 kilograms, with the individuals of six or more meters surpassing 1000 kilograms.
Two biologists working with the History Channel series MonsterQuest spotted and filmed a crocodile they estimated to be 5 to 5.5 meters, deep within Everglades National Park in Florida.
<header>Distribution and habitat
The American crocodile is the most widespread of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas.
It inhabits waters such as mangrove swamps, river mouths, fresh waters, and salt lakes, and can even be found at sea, hence its wide distribution throughout the Caribbean islands, southern Florida, the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, Central America, and the South American countries of Colombia and Ecuador.
The American crocodile is especially plentiful in Costa Rica.
One of its largest documented populations is in Lago Enriquillo, a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic.
The species has also been recorded from Jamaica.
American crocodiles have recently been sighted in Grand Cayman, leading experts to believe the species may be swimming from Cuba and slowly repopulating Grand Cayman.
In addition, an American crocodile/Cuban crocodile hybrid was recently discovered in the Cancun area.
The crocodile likely originated in the Zapata Swamp of Cuba and swam to the Yucatán Peninsula.
Their saline tolerance also allowed the American crocodile to colonize limited portions of the United States.
Contrary to popular misinformation, the presence of the American alligator is not the reason the American crocodile was unable to populate brackish waters north of Florida, but rather the climate.
American crocodiles, unlike American alligators, are extremely susceptible to cold temperatures and live exclusively within tropical waters.
During 2009, unusually cold weather in southern Florida resulted in the deaths of about 150 wild American crocodiles, including a well-known crocodile which inhabited Sanibel Island far north of their natural range.
American crocodiles in the United States coexist with the American alligator, and are primarily found south of the latitude of Miami, in Everglades National Park, Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Florida Keys.
A sizable population occurs near Homestead, Florida, at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station.
Some individuals wander northward to warm summer waters and have been sighted in Sarasota County and Palm Beach County.
In the summer of 2008, a crocodile was captured in the surf on Isle of Palms, South Carolina.
In 2013, a 700-pound crocodile was captured in Tarpon Springs, Florida.
Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission program staff note that the crocodile was not weighed to be 700 pounds.
The weight was estimated by the Nuisance Alligator Trapper who inadvertently caught the animal using a baited hook.
American crocodiles of similar lengths have been accurately weighed at 450-500 pounds.
The American crocodile is saltwater-tolerant and have thus been capable of colonizing a multitude of islands within the Caribbean islands and on some coastal Pacific islands as well.
They coexist with the rather smaller spectacled caiman within Central America.
The only other crocodiles present within the American crocodile's range are two species smaller than this species on average: the critically endangered Cuban crocodile, along with the Morelet's crocodile in southern Mexico and Guatemala.
<header>Biology and behavior
American crocodiles are more susceptible to cold than American alligators.
While an American alligator can survive in water of 7.2 °C  for some time, an American crocodile in that environment would become helpless and drown.
American crocodiles, however, have a faster growth rate than alligators, and are much more tolerant of salt water.
Cleaning symbiosis involving the American crocodile as client has been described.
Unlike the Old World crocodiles, which are sometimes cleared of parasites by birds, the American crocodile relies more on fish for parasite removal.
<subheader>Hunting and diet
American crocodiles are apex predators, and any aquatic or terrestrial animal they encounter in freshwater, riparian and coastal saltwater habitats is potential prey.
For a long time, primary prey throughout their lifetime was thought to be fish; due to the relatively narrow snout as indicative of this piscivorous preference.
However new studies shed light into the dietary preference of this species.
The snout of the American crocodile is broader than some specialized fish-eating crocodilians, allowing it to supplement its diet with a wider variety of prey.
In addition the snout gets even broader and bulkier as the animal matures, a sign for a shift in prey items.
Prey species have ranged in size from the insects taken by young crocodiles to full-grown cattle taken by large adults, and can include various birds, mammals, turtles, crabs, snails, frogs, and occasionally carrion.
In Haiti, hatchling and juvenile crocodiles lived primarily off of fiddler crabs, making up 33.8% and 62.3% of the diet by weight, respectively.
Elsewhere, aquatic insects and their larvae and snails are near the top of the food list for crocodiles at this very early age.
Immature and subadult crocodiles, per a study in Mexico, have a more diverse diet that can include insects, fish, frogs, small turtles, birds and small mammals.
One specimen of 1.2 meters had a catfish, a mourning dove and a bare-tailed woolly opossum in its stomach.
In Florida, bass, tarpon and especially mullet, large crabs, snakes, mammals that habit the riparian and coastal regions of the Everglades, such as opossums and raccoons appeared to be the primary prey of subadult and adult American crocodiles.
In Haiti, adults appeared to live largely off of various birds, followed by concentrations of marine fish including Tilapia and Cichlasoma, at times being seen to capture turtles, dogs and goats.
One 3 meters adult from Honduras had stomach contents consisting of a 1.5 meters crocodile of its own species, a turtle shell and peccary hooves.
It was noted that historically in Mexico that, among several local farmers, the capturing of livestock by crocodiles has been a source of some conflict between humans and crocodiles and large adults occasionally can become habitual predators of goats, dogs, pigs and cattle.
In Quintana Roo, Mexico, most prey that could be determined was fish for sub-adults and adults with sub-adults having a broader prey base than either younger or adult crocodiles.
In Costa Rica, American crocodiles have been recorded hunting and killing adult female olive ridley sea turtles when they come to nest around beaches.
Reportedly, these crocodiles hunt primarily in the first few hours after nightfall, especially on moonless nights, although they will feed at any time.
It hunts in the typical way for most crocodilian, ambushing terrestrial prey when it comes to edge of the water or is sitting in shallows and dragging it down to be drowned or attempting to ambush aquatic prey from near the surface of the water.
<subheader>Interspecies predatory relations
Adult American crocodiles have no natural predators and almost any terrestrial or riparian animal they encounter is potential prey.
American crocodiles are known predators of lemon sharks, and sharks avoid areas with crocodiles.
Usually American crocodiles are dominant over alligators.
However on one occasion, an American crocodile, in a Florida zoo escaped its cage and started a fight with a large male American alligator in a bordering pen and was killed by the alligator.
Conversely, there is one confirmed case of a crocodile preying on a sub-adult alligator in the wild in Florida.
Alligators and crocodiles do not often come into conflict in the wild normally, due largely to habitat partitioning and largely separate distributions.
There are several records of American crocodiles killing and eating spectacled caimans in South America as well as additional records of cannibalism there.
Areas with healthy American crocodile populations remain often find limited numbers of spectacled caimans, while conversely areas that formerly held crocodiles but where they are now heavily depleted or are locally extinct show a growth of caiman numbers, due to less competition as well as predation.
In areas where the two species coexist, smaller but more aggressive Cuban crocodile is behaviorally dominant over the larger American crocodile.
In Mexico some Morelet's crocodiles individuals have escaped from captivity, make feral populations and creating a problem for the populations of American crocodile, which must compete with this invasive species.
<subheader>Reproduction
American crocodiles breed in late fall or early winter, engaging in drawn-out mating ceremonies in which males emit very low frequency bellows to attract females.
Body size is more important than age in determining reproductive capabilities, and females reach sexual maturity at a length of about 2.8 meters.
In February or March, gravid females will begin to create nests of sand, mud, and dead vegetation along the water's edge.
Nest location is crucial, and with the correct amount of vegetation, the eggs will develop within a small temperature range.
Because sex determination is temperature-dependent in crocodilians, slight aberrations in temperature may result in all-male or all-female clutches, which would possibly harm the health of the population.
About one month later, when it is time to lay, the female will dig a wide hole diagonally into the side of the nest and lay 30 to 70 eggs in it, depending on her size.
After laying, the female may cover the eggs with debris or leave them uncovered.
The white, elongated eggs are 8 centimeters long and 5 centimeters wide and have a number of pores in the brittle shell.
During the 75- to 80-day incubation period, the parents will guard the nest, often inhabiting a hole in the bank nearby.
Females especially have been known to guard their nests with ferocity.
But in spite of these precautions, crocodile eggs sometimes fall prey to raccoons, coatis, foxes, skunks or other scavenging mammals in Mexico and American black bears in south Florida, as well as large predatory ants, crabs and vultures.
In Panama, green iguana were seen to dig up and prey on American crocodile eggs occasionally, although in several cases were caught by the mother crocodile and subsequently consumed.
Crocodilian eggs are somewhat brittle, but softer than bird eggs.
Young of this species hatch after 75–80 days.
This species exists mostly in tropical areas with distinct rainy seasons, and the young hatch near the time of the first rains of the summer , after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood.
In this stage of development of their young, mother crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care.
During the hatching process, when the young crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks.
These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered.
Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up with her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source.
The hatchlings, which are 24 to 27 centimeters in length, have been reported to actively hunt prey within a few days of hatching.
It is not uncommon for the mother to care for her young even weeks after they have hatched, remaining attentive to their calls and continuing to provide transportation.
About five weeks after hatching, the young crocodiles disband in search of their own independent lives.
Most of them, of course, will not survive, being preyed upon by several types of raptorial birds and larger fishes, boa constrictors, black spiny-tailed iguana, spectacled caimans, as well as raccoons.
Those that do survive the early stages of life will grow rapidly, feeding on insects, fish and frogs.
Additionally, some young crocodiles reportedly will feed on each other.
<header>Conservation status
Due to hide hunting, pollution, loss of habitat, and removal of adults for commercial farming, the American crocodile is endangered in parts of its range.
In 1972, Venezuela banned commercial crocodile skin harvesting for a decade, as a result of 1950s and 1960s overhunting.
1,000-2,000 American crocodiles live in Mexico and Central and South America, but populations are data deficient.
The American crocodile is considered a vulnerable species, but has not been assessed since 1996.
It has an estimated wild population of 500 to 1,200 in southern Florida.
On March 20, 2007, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service declassified the American crocodile as an endangered species, downgrading its status to "threatened"; the reptile remains protected from illegal harassing, poaching, or killing under the federal Endangered Species Act.
In southern Florida, 67.8% of crocodile mortality was attributed most likely to road collisions, 10.5% were due to intentional killing and only 4.9% could be contributed to natural causes.
<header>Relationship with humans
American crocodiles are dangerous to humans; attacks in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama are not unprecedented.
These attacks rarely make international news, so this species is not as well-documented as a man-eater, as are its relatives.
The species is often reportedly timid, and seemingly lacks the propensity to attack people as regularly as Old World crocodiles do.
Crocodiles are, as a general rule are more aggressive than alligators.
The American crocodile rates, temperamentally somewhere in the middle of all crocodilians.
A study by the IUCN found that the American crocodile has the highest incidence of reported attacks on humans, but fatalities were rare <Sideleau & Britton>.
The estimated number of attacks is considerably smaller than those by the saltwater and Nile crocodiles.
The saltwater and Nile crocodiles are considered to be the most aggressive and dangerous species towards humans.
Reportedly, the Cuban crocodile is rather more aggressive in interspecies interactions than the American crocodile and apparently attacks and displaces American crocodiles when they are kept in mixed species enclosures at zoos or at crocodile farms together, even though it is smaller than the American species.
However, attacks are rarely reportedly in Cuban crocodiles, undoubtedly due its much more limited habitat and range.
In May 2007, two instances occurred within one week of children being attacked and killed by this species—one in Mexico just south of Puerto Vallarta and one in Costa Rica.
On August 24, 2014, a man and a woman were swimming in a canal in Gables by the Sea, a community in Coral Gables, Florida, at 2:00 AM, in a canal where crocodiles were known to occur, when they were bitten in the shoulder and the hand by an American crocodile.
Although the crocodile was 12' 1" in length, and weighed an estimated 550 pounds, it did not press the attack, but released.
and moved away from its victims.
This was the first documented wild crocodile attack on humans in Florida since records of human-crocodile conflict have been kept.
On May 19, 2015, a seven-year-old boy was attacked and killed by an American Crocodile in the Barra Santa Ana estuary near the city of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico.
This was reportedly the eighth crocodile attack in the Barra Santa Ana estuary in the last two years.
